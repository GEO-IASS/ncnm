This is the release of the software that was used for constructing experiments listed in the paper at http://ext.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~u0015/cgi-bin/bibpage.cgi?keyName=Lawrence:semisuper04.

The software relies on version 0.31 of my IVM code and makes use of Anton Schwaighofer's SVM light MATLAB interface, available at http://www.cis.tugraz.at/igi/aschwaig/software.html
